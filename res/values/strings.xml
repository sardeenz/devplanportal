        Welcome to the <b>What&apos;s Around Me?</b> demo application. 
        <p>
        What&apos;s Around Me? allows location based searches around important places of interest provided
        by open government data sets.
        </p>
        <p>Have you ever seen a construction site and 
        wondered, "What's going on over there? What are they building?" This application allows you to 
        search for an address or take your current location and display information about 
        the chosen area from multiple data sets.        
        </p>
      <p>
      	Currently, the background process gets any development plan data within a specified radius of your location or
      	of the location entered.
